                        This project is intended to arouse the pursuit of freedom and equality among the LGBTQIA programmer community, even though we all know that this will not stir up waves. Whether straight, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, or asexual, people are born equal and have equal human rights, which cannot be denied.</p>

                                <strong>LGBTQIA</strong> is an acronym that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersexual, asexual and our supporters. This group of sexual minorities needs to be respected because we are born this way.

                            <p>
                                Due to China's traditional cultural background, the LGBTQIA community is not well received in China and is not recognized or respected by others. This project is established to find LGBTQIA community members or people who support LGBTQIA equality among open source workers, and to improve the situation of the LGBTQIA community in China from the perspective of public opinion. Although the impact will not be great, it is better than nothing.

                            <h2>Why do LGBTQIA people need equal rights?</h2>
                            <p>
                                LGBTQIA is a minority group. Although LGBTQIA are also ordinary people, it is undeniable that we are different from the majority heterosexuals, and our political rights cannot be fully protected. Freedom and equality are always the most important in modern society. In China, LGBTQIA has not received true freedom and equality. In order for this group to live a normal life, we need to fight for equal rights.

                            <p>
                                Just like you respect any friend around you, treat LGBTQIA people as normal people. Remember that LGBTQIA is not a disease in any form. Even if you have physical differences, LGBTQIA people are normal people. At the same time, LGBTQIA people do need more care than heterosexuals because LGBTQIA people often lack a sense of security and long for recognition.
